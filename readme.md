Simple Clip Editor
==================

User Story:

You play video games and use clip software to create clips out of your gameplay using eg. Xbox Game Bar or OBS Replay Buffer.

The result is a bunch of different video files containing past gameplay. Due to how clips work each video file contains more footage than the actual interesting content.

As a user I wish to be able to splice and stitch these videos together with minimal effort.
